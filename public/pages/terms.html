            <h1>License Terms and Terms of Use</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date: 2025-10-28</strong></p>

            <div class="legal-content">
                <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Touti mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by this End User License Agreement and Terms of Use (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you do not agree, do not install or use the App.</p>

                <h3>1. Contracting Party</h3>
                <p>This Agreement is between you and the developer/publisher of Touti ("Developer," "we," "us," or "our"). Apple Inc. ("Apple") and Google LLC ("Google") are not parties to this Agreement and have no obligations regarding the App except as expressly stated below.</p>

                <h3>2. Eligibility and Account</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must be legally able to enter this Agreement and comply with applicable law. If you are under the age required by local law to consent to data processing or to enter contracts, you must have parental/guardian consent.</li>
                    <li>Some features require an account provided by our authentication partner, PlayFab (a Microsoft service). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity under your account.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. License Grant</h3>
                <p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download and use one copy of the App on a device that you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial entertainment.</p>

                <h3>4. License Restrictions</h3>
                <p>You may not and will not permit others to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the App except to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by law</li>
                    <li>(b) copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works</li>
                    <li>(c) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices</li>
                    <li>(d) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer the App</li>
                    <li>(e) use the App for any unlawful purpose, to infringe rights of others, or to interfere with the App's servers, security, or networks</li>
                    <li>(f) use cheats, automation software, bots, mods, hacks, or any unauthorized third-party software</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Online Features; Leaderboards and Cloud Data (Azure)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The App offers online features such as leaderboards, matchmaking, or cloud saves. To operate these features, gameplay data is processed and stored in Microsoft Azure.</li>
                    <li>Categories of data processed for these features typically include: in-game identifiers (e.g., account or player ID), display name or username, stable device identifiers (or app-generated equivalents), gameplay telemetry (scores, match results, session timestamps, progression), limited device/platform information, IP address (used to infer coarse location), and anti-cheat signals. Exact data may vary by feature and platform.</li>
                    <li>We use Azure to provide reliable, low-latency services globally. Your data may be processed in data centers outside your country, subject to appropriate safeguards.</li>
                    <li>If you opt out of cloud processing or request deletion of your account, certain features (for example, leaderboards or cloud progression) may become unavailable or function in a limited manner.</li>
                    <li>Realtime multiplayer networking is provided via Photon (Exit Games). Photon processes network/session metadata (e.g., IP address, region, user identifier or nickname, room and event data, connection quality) to route traffic, maintain rooms, and deliver gameplay, subject to Photon's terms and privacy policy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Accounts and Authentication (PlayFab)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We use PlayFab (a Microsoft service) to provide account services and authentication. When you sign in, PlayFab may collect and process account-related data, including identifiers (such as a PlayFab ID), login events, device/platform information, and gameplay linkages, in accordance with their terms and privacy policy.</li>
                    <li>Your use of PlayFab-enabled features constitutes your acceptance of PlayFab's terms and privacy statement. See <a href="https://playfab.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayFab Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a> for details.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. Data Protection and Privacy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We process personal data to operate the App, provide online features (including leaderboards and multiplayer networking), ensure security, prevent fraud/cheating, and improve the game.</li>
                    <li>Legal bases (where applicable) include performance of a contract (to provide the App and features), legitimate interests (to secure and improve the service), and your consent (where required by law).</li>
                    <li>Your rights (subject to local law) may include the right to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to processing, and data portability. You can exercise rights via in-app support or the contact details below. We will verify requests as required by law.</li>
                    <li>We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described, unless a longer period is required by law. When data is no longer needed, we delete or anonymize it.</li>
                    <li>We use Microsoft Azure, PlayFab (Microsoft), and Photon (Exit Games) as processors/service providers. We may share data with service providers who support our operations under appropriate contracts. We do not sell personal data.</li>
                    <li>For EEA/UK/Swiss users: when transferring data outside your region, we rely on appropriate transfer mechanisms (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) where required.</li>
                    <li>For California residents: we do not sell or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. You may exercise rights as described above.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. User Content and Conduct</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for any content you submit (e.g., usernames, chat). Do not post content that is illegal, infringing, harmful, or otherwise objectionable. We may remove content or suspend accounts that violate this Agreement or applicable law.</p>

                <h3>9. Virtual Items and Gameplay Balance</h3>
                <p>Virtual currency, items, and progression have no monetary value and are licensed, not owned. We may manage, regulate, modify, or remove them at any time. No refunds are provided except as required by law or platform policy.</p>

                <h3>10. Maintenance and Support</h3>
                <p>We are solely responsible for providing maintenance and support for the App. Apple and Google have no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services for the App.</p>

                <h3>11. Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. Your use is at your sole risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusions of implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you.</p>

                <h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither we nor our affiliates, licensors, or service providers will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising from or related to your use of or inability to use the App, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability for all claims shall not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the App or the last 12 months of in-app purchases for the App. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the above may not apply to you.</p>

                <h3>13. Indemnity</h3>
                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us and our affiliates harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your breach of this Agreement or violation of any law or third-party right.</p>

                <h3>14. Suspension and Termination</h3>
                <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App (including accounts) for conduct that we believe violates this Agreement or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties. Upon termination, the license granted to you will end and you must cease all use of the App. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive.</p>

                <h3>15. Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>The App is not directed to children where parental consent is required by law without verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child without proper consent, we will take appropriate steps to delete such data.</p>

                <h3>16. Updates and Changes</h3>
                <p>We may provide updates that may modify or delete features and/or functionality. You agree that we may update the App automatically and that this Agreement will apply to updates. We may revise this Agreement by posting an updated version in the App or on our website, with the Effective Date updated above. Your continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>

                <h3>17. Export and Sanctions Compliance</h3>
                <p>You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You will comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws.</p>

                <h3>18. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
                <p>Except where prohibited by local law, this Agreement and any dispute will be governed by the laws of your country or state of residence, without regard to conflict of law principles. You may have the right to bring claims in the courts of your place of residence as a consumer. Mandatory consumer protection laws of your residence will apply.</p>

                <h3>19. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>The App may link to or integrate third-party services (including PlayFab, Azure, and Photon). Your use of third-party services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party content or services.</p>

                <h3>20. Apple App Store Terms (Third-Party Beneficiary)</h3>

                <h3>23. Jurisdiction-Specific Notice — Morocco (Law 09-08)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are resident in Morocco, the processing of personal data is subject to Law No. 09-08 relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. You have rights of access, rectification, and deletion of your personal data, and the right to object to processing on legitimate grounds.</li>
                    <li>Cross-border data transfers: online features (including leaderboards and multiplayer) rely on infrastructure outside Morocco (e.g., Microsoft Azure and Photon).

                    <li>Supervisory authority: you may contact the CNDP for information or to lodge a complaint. See <a href="https://www.cndp.ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNDP</a>.</li>
