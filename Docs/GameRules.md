### Touti Game Rules (canonical)

This document defines the canonical rules used by the game logic. Keep it in sync with `Assets/Scripts/GameLogic/` behavior.

- Deck: 40 cards (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12 in suits O, C, E, B)
- Teams: Players (1,3) vs (2,4)
- Engagement: ascending bids; last valid bidder wins and chooses trump (fire)
- Trick play: follow suit if possible; otherwise play trump if possible; otherwise any
- Scoring: per-card points plus last-trick +10; singing grants additional points under limits

Note: Expand with examples and corner cases as rules are finalized.
